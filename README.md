# Python-Excel-Executable

This program will first check for any .msg files in  the path, downloading any PDF attatchments from the emails and then moving the .msg files to a subfolder.

This program will then convert all PDF files in the path to xlsx files. 

It will then append them to a final xlsx file and move the individual PDFs and xlxs files into different folders.

The application will automatically generate the final xlsx file and sub folders if necessary.
